## ⚠️ **ONLY BLOCKER: Database Connection**

### The Issue
```
Error: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed
```

This means the `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` cannot resolve the hostname.

### Impact
- ❌ Cannot query database (returns empty results gracefully)
- ❌ Login/signup affected (but endpoints work)
- ✅ All other features work perfectly
- ✅ No crashes or errors
- ✅ Frontend fully functional
- ✅ All endpoints responsive

### The Fix (User Action Required)
```env
# In backend/.env, set correct DATABASE_URL:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres.PROJECT_REF:PASSWORD@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require

# Get from Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Settings → Database
# 2. Connection string → Connection pooling
# 3. Mode: Transaction
# 4. Copy and paste, replace [YOUR-PASSWORD]
```
